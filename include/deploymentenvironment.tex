Linux without preemptive kernel patch
\subsection{RT-Preempt}
Present the preempt kernel patch

\section{Docker}
Docker is a container virtualization technology \cite{anderson2015docker} which utilizes the advantages, while mitigating the performance bottleneck of virtual machines. Illustrated in [figure], VMs are fully contained operating systems running on top of a hypervisor, which in terms are running on top of the host OS \cite{bernstein2014containers}. This creates additional layers between the hardware and application which results in a decrease in performance. Comparing the performance of Virtual Machines and Docker it becomes evident that the containers performs considerably better than VMs. However having a marginal performance loss compared to running an application natively on the host OS \cite{vmvscontainers}.\\\\

Although Docker generates a performance loss compared to native, it expands the spectra of work flows and development performance. [Write about workflow gains]
